## 📖 Overview
This project presents a **real-time visual analytics dashboard** designed to assist emergency responders in assessing the damage caused by an earthquake in **St. Himark**. By leveraging **D3.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, the dashboard integrates multiple interactive visualizations such as:
- 🗺️ **Choropleth Maps** – To identify the most affected areas.  
- 📊 **Bar & Violin Charts** – To analyze damage distribution and data reliability.  
- ⏳ **Stream Graphs & Slope Graphs** – To track changes in conditions over time.

This visualization system **enhances decision-making** by providing emergency teams with **insights into critical infrastructure failures**, prioritizing **resource allocation**, and assessing **data uncertainty** from citizen reports.
